  I\'m a nomad Software Engineer, always searching for the next challenge; no
  task is too scary nor too difficult. Lately I have been immersed in the
  <b>crypto-world</b> working for Radix, a London based startup trying to create
  the next massive scalable DLT. I'm one of the two guys behind all the JS
  related stuff.
